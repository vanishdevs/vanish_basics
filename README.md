This resource offers essential scripts that can be toggled for enhanced server functionality and customization. I am hoping for this resource to include way more features and be the go-to resource for servers to control basics that are optimized instead of searching the forum for such simple stuff. Opening up issues if seen or contributing via PR would be greatly appreciated for the development of this resource.
